A website was created for project using git, html, and css.
***There seems to be a 404 error accessing the homepage using https://jeffreythompson1.github.io/project0/home.html, but using https://jeffreythompson1.github.io/project0/home seems to work fine and I don't know why. If you wish to return to the homepage please enter the latter link.

A checklist of various requirements of the project and where to find them is as follows:

1.  -Website contains 5 pages: home.html, ds1.html, ds2.html, ds3.html, and bb.html
    -Links to non-home pages exist in the top bar of every page, links to the home page       exist at the bottom of every non-home page
    
2.  -Lists can be found on the page "ds1.html" (Dark Souls link)
    -Table is found on the home page
    -One image is included at the bottom of every page
    
3.  -Website includes the stylesheet file "project0stle.css"

4.  -Stylesheet includes properties such as color, background-color, text-align,             padding, border, margin, width, font-style, font-weight, and vertical-align
    -class selectors ".container", ".title", and ".image" are used
    -id selector "#current" is used
    
5.  -For @media query, the style sheet reformats the width of the bootstrap grid to only      take up %80 of the screen when once the screen is small enough to flex the columns      of the grid into rows

6.  -Bootstrap 4 is included
    -Made a dropdown on the page "ds1.html", can't get it to really do anything
    -The grid model is used at the top of every page to show the links to other pages

7.  -The stylesheet "project0style.scss" is included
    -$alignment is a variable applied to anything aligned in the website
    -Nesting occurs in the ordered list where the list items are bolded and the              paragraph bits are a smaller font
    -Inheritance is used in formatting the table (%tableformat) where all table items        all table items are given the same border color and padding
